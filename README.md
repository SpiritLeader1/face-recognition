** How to start**
1) First of all, if you are using a different computer, you need to one of the below batch files according to participants' age category. If you are using the same computer, you can skip this step.
    - experimentPrepOld.bat
    - experimentPrepYoung.bat
2) Open Opensesame then write csv files related to its section. This is applicable for study and interval tasks
3) Copy everything the inside of testtask_combined_faces_**age_category**.xlsx  and paste into according section in Opensesame.
4) You are ready to start the experiment.

** Update List:**
- Add a Python script that combines all test task preparations. (No additional action required to run that. It is inside the batch file)

** Known Error:**
- Old people files has missing photos for test task in seen faces. (The array size is mismatched)
